                <h2>My Motivation for Becoming a Frontend Developer</h2>
                <p>As a computer science student, my interest in frontend development sparked during my third-year
                    course, CSC 312. The process of creating a website fascinated me, and I found myself eager to learn
                    more about how it all worked. After class, I would spend time exploring on my own, diving deeper
                    into how I could build and solve problems with code.</p>
                <p>During my internship, I was able to focus even more on frontend development. I learned a great deal
                    and managed to build several projects. Now, two years into coding, I've advanced further and started
                    learning JavaScript frameworks, with a particular focus on React.</p>

                <h2>How HNG Can Help</h2>
                <p>When I first came across HNG’s description, I was immediately intrigued. It was exactly what I was
                    looking for, so I decided to enroll. Since then, I’ve felt more motivated to code and improve my
                    skills. Seeing the amazing projects completed by others inspires me to push myself harder and
                    approach every task with full dedication.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>My Goals</h2>
                <p>One of my main goals is to reach the final stage of this program. Through my research, I've
                    discovered that not everyone who applies makes it to the end. I’m determined not to be part of that
                    group. To achieve this, I’ll make use of the resources available to me—both online and from my
                    moderators and peers in the group. I’m confident that staying committed will help me succeed and
                    earn great results.</p>

                    developers you can hire through HNG. Depending on the area you're focusing on, you can easily find
                     <a href="https://hng.tech/hire/reactjs-developers">React developers</a> here. It’s a fantastic network to tap into!</p>
